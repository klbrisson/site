                The majority of my experience has been through working on the Financial Times website. 
                One project that I am proud of is an <a href="//markets.ft.com/data/world">interactive map</a> I built using D3.js.
                This library enabled clients to instantiate an interactive map with just a couple lines of code.
                It provided an easy interface to work with, saving development time on future mapping projects.

                During one of my college courses, I had an assignment to create a timeline of the history of computers in PowerPoint, Word, or another format. 
                I thought it would be more interesting to build a website for this assignment. 
                In doing so I was able to not only learn about the history of computers, but also how to use Angular 2.
                If you would like to check out the site I built for this assignment, you can see it <a href="/timeline">here</a>.
