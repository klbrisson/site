            <h3>Interactive map using D3.js</h3>
            <p>
                The majority of my experience has been through working on the Financial Times website. 
                One project that I am proud of is an interactive map I built using D3.js.
                This library enabled clients to instantiate an interactive map with just a couple lines of code.
                It provided an easy interface to work with, saving development time on future mapping projects.

                <li>C#</li>
                <li>D3.js</li>
                <li>jQuery</li>
                <li>HTML5/CSS3</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a href="/timeline">Timeline</a> for college course</h3>
            <p>
                During one of my college courses, I had an assignment to create a timeline of the history of computers in PowerPoint, Word, or another format. 
                I thought it would be more interesting to build a website for this assignment. 
                In doing so I was able to not only learn about the history of computers, but also how to use Angular 2.

                <li>Angular 2</li>
                <li>Node.js</li>
                <li>HTML5/CSS3</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>My next project?</h3>
            <p>
                I created a course scheduling app for college students when I attended RefactorU and I am working to recreate this app using Angular 2.
